Whispers of the Dawn

In the soft blush of a gentle morning,  
whispers stir the quiet earth,  
as dew-dropped petals open  
to the tender kiss of light.

Shadows yield to the dancing hues  
of amber, rose, and gold—  
a silent serenade of renewal,  
a promise woven in dawn’s embrace.

Beyond the reach of midnight’s rest,  
the heart awakens with a subtle stir;  
each breath a quiet prayer  
to the unfolding mystery of day.

In the melody of rustling leaves  
and the murmur of a sleeping stream,  
there lies a secret harmony,  
an eternal song of hope.
